					<h1>About</h1>
					<h6>Myself</h6>
				</div>
				<p>
					Dedicated professional passionate about
					designing and building scalable software
					solutions that would serve the Army of
					today and the future.
				</p>

				<p>
					I have served in the U.S. Army for the
					past 15 years. The last 2 of which have
					been in Special Operations as a Data Analyst
					and Software Developer. I have served on small
					collaborative teams in ambiguous
					missions across the world to include the
					U.S. Embassy Kiev, Ukraine. As I pursue
					a career in software development I am
					looking to combine my passion for
					programming with my 15 years of military
					experience in order to serve with a team
					on the leading edge of technology.
				</p>

				<p>
					I recently obtained my Master of
					Science in Data Science from
					<a href="https://www.eastern.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ms-data-science" class="courses">
						Eastern University</a>
					as well as supplementing my learning with additional online resources.

					<h1>Versatile</h1>
					<p>
						Throughout my life I have taken an approach that challenges me to continuously seek knowledge
						and learn.
						My ability to grasp new concepts is best displayed through 
						my progression of different roles within my military career.
						I have displayed my ability to
						constantly expand my knowledge
						and test my abilities. As well as gained the confidence to master new skills. My
						ambitious personality is a
						great fit for many cultures.

						Passionate
					</h1>
					<p>
						What once started as a hobby, has 
						driven me to pursue a career in 
						software development. My passion has 
						allowed me to obtain knowledge in object oriented
						languages like Java and C#, in addition to self learning Python.
						As well as familiarizing myself with
						front-end and back-end frameworks like React and
						Spring Boot. Additionally, it has driven me to understand
						version control systems GitLab and Github.

					<h1>
						Collaborative
					</h1>
					<p>
						I have
						experience working with and
						leading teams of 5 to 15
						individuals, to include software development teams. This experience has allowed me to not only understand the importance 
						of a collaborative work environment, but also understand my own strengths and weaknesses.
						Through these experiences I have become confident and capable of
						working in autonomous
						environments as well as in
						collaborative
						team environments.
